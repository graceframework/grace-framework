== include



=== Purpose


Includes the response of another controller/action or view in the current response

NOTE: The  `g:include` tag will not generate a separate request. The response from the `include` action will be merged into the response for the original request.


=== Examples


Example controller for an application called "shop":

[source,java]
----
class BookController {
    def list() {
        [books: Book.list(params)]
    }

    def show() {
        [book: Book.get(params.id)]
    }
}
----

Example usages for above controller:

[source,xml]
----
<g:include action="show" id="1" />

<g:include action="show" id="${currentBook.id}" />

<g:include controller="book" />

<g:include controller="book" action="list" />

<g:include action="list" params="[sort: 'title', order: 'asc',
                                  author: currentBook.author]" />
----

Example as a method call in a controller, tag library or GSP:

[source,java]
----
def content = g.include(action: 'list', controller: 'book')
----

If using nested includes with params it is advisable to use unique parameter names as they are all attached to the same web request.
[source,xml]
----
<g:include controller="outer" action="list" params="[outerPage:1, outerSize:5]"/>
<g:include controller="inner" action="list" params="[innerPage:2, innerSize:10]"/>
----
If non-unique names are used like the following
[source,xml]
----
<g:include controller="outer" action="list" params="[page:1, size:5]"/>
<g:include controller="inner" action="list" params="[page:2, size:10]"/>
----
request.params will contain a list `params.page=[2,1]` and `params.size=[10,5]`
