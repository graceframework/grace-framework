SiteMesh is a web-page layout system that can be used to abstract common look
and feel from the functionality of a web-application and to assemble large
webpages from smaller components. Pages and components can have meta-data
extracted from them (such as body, title and meta-tags) which can be used by
decorators (skins) that are applied.
