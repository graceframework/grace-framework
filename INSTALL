GRACE CLI - INSTALLATION
========================

Thank you for downloading the Grace CLI. Please follow these instructions
in order to complete your installation.


Prerequisites
-------------
Grace CLI requires Java JDK v17.0 or above in order to run. Groovy v4.0.x
is packaged as part of this distribution, and therefore does not need to be installed (any
existing Groovy installation is ignored).

Grace CLI will use whatever JDK it finds on your path, to check that you have an appropriate
version you should run:

	java -version

Alternatively, you can set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point a suitable JDK.


Environment Variables
---------------------
No specific environment variables are required to run the CLI, however, you may want to
set GRACE_HOME to point to a specific installation. You should also add GRACE_HOME/bin
to your PATH environment variable.



Checking Your Installation
--------------------------
To test if you have successfully installed the CLI you can run the following command:

	grace -v
